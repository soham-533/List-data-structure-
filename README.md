In Python, a list is a versatile and widely used data structure that allows you to store an ordered collection of items. Here's a quick summary:

Key Features:
Ordered: The items in a list maintain the order in which they are added.
Mutable: Lists can be modified after creation (e.g., adding, removing, or changing elements).
Heterogeneous: Lists can store items of different data types (e.g., integers, strings, objects).
Indexed: Elements in a list are accessed using zero-based indexing.# List-data-structure-
